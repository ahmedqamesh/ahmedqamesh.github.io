##  List of My Geek Tutorials
### Data Analysis
- **pattern_calls** : C++ project for beginners to handle information about pattern calls (visit [pattern_calls](https://github.com/ahmedqamesh/pattern_calls))
- **farm_analysis** : Python scripts dedicated to conducting analysis and statistical calculations, such as p-values and correlation coefficients, on real data collected from a farm in 2021 (visit [farm_analysis](https://github.com/ahmedqamesh/farm_analysis)).
- **drug_analysis** : python  script helps in understanding drug interactions by reading data from an Excel file and processing it to find interactions between specified drugs (visit [drug_analysis](https://github.com/ahmedqamesh/drug_analysis)).
